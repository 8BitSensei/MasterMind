MASTERMIND
==========

A small game for Android devices

The games current working title is either Mystery or MasterMind, it is an old project I'm recovering at it's 
had multiple working titles in that time.

HOW TO PLAY
============

The game consits of a simple logical puzzle where in the cx must guess a randomly chosen code

The player must choose a set of 4 numbers ranging from 1 - 4

They will then be given a symbol for each number they have assigned

V - The number chosen is correct and in the right place

S - The number is in the code but not in the right place
 
X - The number does not exist in the code

Guessing all four in the correct order is the victory condition


REWARD SYSTEM
==============

The player has two reward systems, the game records the amount of turns it takes to complete the code and records 
a 'High Score'

The player is also rewarded with 'Medals', these are achievements that they can earn for completeing specific goals

Virgin medal - Win your first game

Cherry model - Beat a code in 5 turns or less
